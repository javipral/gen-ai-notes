# Building Text Generation Applications

## Getting Started

### Integration Approaches

1. **Use an API**

   - Construct web requests with your prompt
   - Receive generated text in response

2. **Use a Library**
   - Encapsulate API calls for ease of use
     - **openai**: Simplifies connection and prompt sending to models
     - **Langchain**: Higher-level operations, supports Python
     - **Semantic Kernel**: By Microsoft, supports C#, Python, and Java

## Different Types of Prompts

Prompts can be tailored for various tasks:

1. **Generate a Type of Text**: Poems, quiz questions
2. **Lookup Information**: "What does CORS mean in web development?"
3. **Generate Code**: Regular expressions, complete programs like web apps
