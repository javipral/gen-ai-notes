### Key Attributes of a Good AI Application

1. **Useful**: Matches its intended purpose (e.g., automating grading or generating flashcards).
2. **Reliable**: Performs tasks consistently and without errors.
3. **Accessible**: Usable by people of all abilities, including those with disabilities.
4. **Pleasant**: Provides an enjoyable user experience.

### Role of AI

- Augments user experience by automating tasks and personalizing interactions.

## Designing AI Applications for Trust and Transparency

### Building Trust

- Trust is essential for user confidence in AI applications.
- Mistrust leads to rejection, while over-trust can lead to issues like inaccurate grading without review.

### Explainability

- **Understanding Decisions**: Users need to understand how AI decisions are made.
- **Clarity**: Provide clear examples of AI capabilities and limitations.
- **Simplified Explanations**: Use simple language for non-experts.

### Control

- **User Collaboration**: Users should modify prompts and outputs to suit their needs.
- **Data Control**: Users can opt-in/out of data sharing for personalized experiences.

## Designing AI Applications for Collaboration and Feedback

### Error Handling

- **Feedback Loop**: Implement ways for users to provide feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down).
- **Clear Communication**: Inform users about the capabilities and limitations of the AI.
- **Error Management**: Provide clear responses when the AI encounters errors or limitations.

### Collaboration

- AI applications should engage in a collaborative manner with users, adjusting based on feedback and user input.
