# Securing Your Generative AI Applications

### Key Points to Consider

- **Impact of AI/ML**: AI/ML significantly affect daily life, necessitating their protection.
- **Security Challenges**: AI/ML products require protection from sophisticated attacks.
- **Strategic Problems**: Proactive measures are essential for long-term customer safety and data security.

### Data Integrity

- **Vulnerability of ML Models**: Unable to distinguish between malicious and benign data.
- **Training Data Risks**: Often sourced from uncurated public datasets, allowing attackers to inject malicious data, leading to compromised model performance over time.

## Understanding the Threats and Risks of AI

### Data Poisoning

Data poisoning involves altering training data to mislead AI models. Examples include:

1. **Label Flipping**: Mislabeling data to create incorrect associations.\
   _Example_: Spam filters misclassifying legitimate emails.
2. **Feature Poisoning**: Modifying features to introduce bias.\
   _Example_: Manipulating recommendation systems with irrelevant keywords.
3. **Data Injection**: Adding malicious data to skew model behavior.\
   _Example_: Fake user reviews affecting sentiment analysis.
4. **Backdoor Attacks**: Inserting hidden patterns to trigger malicious behavior.\
   _Example_: Face recognition systems misidentifying specific individuals.
