# Generative AI Application Lifecycle

The **generative AI lifecycle** is essential for ensuring AI applications remain relevant, reliable, and robust. This guides the development, deployment, and maintenance of gen AI apps, helping you define goals, measure performance, identify challenges, and implement solutions while aligning with ethical and legal standards.

## Paradigm Shift: MLOps to LLMOps

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI tasks, requiring a new approach called **LLMOps**. This shift from traditional **MLOps** involves:

- Focus on app developers and integrations
- Use of "Models-as-a-Service"
- Metrics including quality, harm, honesty, cost, and latency

## The LLM Lifecycle

The **LLM lifecycle** introduces new requirements compared to traditional MLOps, such as prompt engineering, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and new evaluation metrics. Key Steps:

1. **Ideating/Exploring**:
   - **Exploration**: Experiment with various LLMs to test hypotheses.
   - **Prototyping**: For instance with [PromptFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html) to test efficiency.
2. **Building/Augmenting**:

   - **Implementation**: Evaluate with larger datasets, apply techniques like fine-tuning and RAG.
   - **Testing and Scaling**: Ensure robustness and meet evaluation metrics.

3. **Operationalizing**:
   - **Integration**: Add monitoring and alert systems, deploy, and integrate the application.
