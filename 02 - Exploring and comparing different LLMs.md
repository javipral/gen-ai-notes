# Exploring and comparing different LLMs

## Types of LLMs

### Categorization by Use Case

1. **Audio and Speech Recognition**: Whisper-type models are suitable for multilingual speech recognition.
2. **Image Generation**: DALL-E and Midjourney are popular choices.
3. **Text Generation**: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are widely used, with GPT-4 being the most expensive.
4. **Multi-modality**: Models like GPT-4 Turbo can handle multiple types of input and output data.

### Foundation Models vs. LLMs

- **Foundation Models**: Very large models trained on multi-modal data using unsupervised or self-supervised learning, serving as a base for other models (e.g., GPT-3.5 for ChatGPT).
- **LLMs**: May be built on foundation models and fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### Open Source vs. Proprietary Models

- **Open Source Models**: Available for public use, modifiable, and customizable (e.g., Alpaca, Bloom, LLaMA).
- **Proprietary Models**: Owned by companies, optimized for production use, often require payment (e.g., OpenAI models, Google Bard, Claude 2).

### Model Output Types

1. **Embeddings**: Convert text into numerical form for machine understanding (e.g., OpenAI embeddings).
2. **Image Generation**: Create new images or edit existing ones (e.g., DALL-E-3, Stable Diffusion).
3. **Text and Code Generation**: Generate text or code, used for summarization, translation, and question answering (e.g., CodeParrot).

### Model Architectures

1. **Decoder-only Models**: Generate content based on a given topic (e.g., GPT-3).
2. **Encoder-only Models**: Understand context and relationships (e.g., BERT).
3. **Encoder-Decoder Models**: Combine the abilities of both encoder and decoder models (e.g., BART, T5).

### Service vs. Model

- **Services**: Cloud-based, combining models, data, and other components, optimized for production use (e.g., Azure OpenAI Service).
- **Models**: Core neural networks, can be run locally but require computational resources (e.g., LLaMA).

## Improving LLM Results

### Approaches to Improve Performance

1. **Prompt Engineering with Context**: Provide detailed prompts with examples to improve accuracy.
2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Augment prompts with external data, useful when lacking data for fine-tuning.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Train models further on specific data for improved performance.
4. **Training from Scratch**: Suitable for domain-specific use cases with a large amount of data.
