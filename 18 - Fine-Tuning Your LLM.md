# Fine-Tuning Your LLM

## What is Fine-Tuning for Language Models?

Large language models are initially pre-trained on extensive and diverse text data. Techniques like **prompt engineering** and **retrieval-augmented generation** modify the input prompt to enhance response quality, but fine-tuning retrains the model itself with specific data.

### Prompt Engineering Limitations

- **Token Limits**: Restrict the number of examples.
- **Cost**: High token costs for including examples in prompts.

### Fine-Tuning Advantages

- Improves model performance for specific tasks or domains.
- Reduces the need for extensive few-shot learning examples, lowering token usage and costs.

## When and Why to Fine-Tune Models?

### Supervised Fine-Tuning

Involves retraining with new data not in the original dataset, different from unsupervised fine-tuning which uses the original data with different hyperparameters.

### Considerations for Fine-Tuning

1. **Use Case**: Define the specific improvements needed.
2. **Alternatives**: Evaluate other techniques like prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation.
3. **Costs**:
   - **Tunability**: Is the pre-trained model available for fine-tuning?
   - **Effort**: Data preparation, model evaluation, and refinement.
   - **Compute**: Resources for running and deploying fine-tuning jobs.
   - **Data**: Availability of quality examples.
4. **Benefits**:
   - **Quality**: Better performance compared to the baseline.
   - **Cost Reduction**: Lower token usage by simplifying prompts.
   - **Extensibility**: Repurposing for new domains.

## How to Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Model

Requirements for fine-tuning:

- A pre-trained model.
- A curated dataset for fine-tuning.
- A suitable training environment.
- A hosting environment for deployment.

Consider the use case, alternatives, costs, and benefits, to determine if fine-tuning is the appropriate approach for an app.
